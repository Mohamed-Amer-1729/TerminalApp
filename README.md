# Terminal App

The purpose of this project was to test my abilities using C# while doing something visually appealing. This was before I learned about OOP.

The app works by connecting the terminal app with a database and query some data in a standardized format. The app then outputs thise data according to settings the user specified which consists 
of changing colors of the terminal and the speed of outputting words. The user has the ability to query the data according to an input from the terminal.

The app also allows a rudiemantary form of journalling, as it allows the user to take journal entries that records the time of the day and saves it to the journal with the same date of taking the journal entry.
