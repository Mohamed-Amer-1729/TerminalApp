Chances are, if you have already reached this state, then you know how bad things have gotten/will get.  I am not asking you to dwell on why you got here, neither to believe in anything right now. All I am asking is this. Close everything. Leave your room. And don't lose hope, for despair only fills the heart of the non-believers.
