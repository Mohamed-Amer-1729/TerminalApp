This state is reserved for people who are stressed out, feeling too tired, but can still focus on tasks. It can be in the exams, deadline of a project, etc. In this state, the barer should go into full power saving mode, leaving only the most important tasks to perform. Failure to do so would lead the bearer to more destructive habits and self harm on the long run.
