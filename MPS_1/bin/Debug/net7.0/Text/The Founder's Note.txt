The quest of happiness and fulfilment has been humanity's ultimate quest since the dawn of time. We strived to improve our food by growing our own crops and raising our own cattle. We strived to enhance our bodies and protect our families by carrying rocks up mountains and engaging in fights with our friends. We strived to broaden the limits of our thinking and the power of our technology so we researched mathematics and chemistry to explain the world around us. And lastly, we have been enlightened by god to worship him, so we do not fall in despair living in his kingdom.
Despite these best efforts, there comes dark moments in every human's life where he feels hopeless, lost, resentful whether from the world around him or from within himself. I am here to fight this. I do not know who you are or where you are, but know that this is not how it supposed to be. Our current age, with its unprecedented technologies and wide arrays of knowledge, poses a number of threats to humanity as a whole and as an individual. In here, I have catalogued many findings that will help in your travels through your life. I wish only for your well-being, and for you to carry the torch and help other people with their sickness. 
Don't let the world become a sadder place, for we are the successors of this earth, and our kingdom shall be beautiful.
