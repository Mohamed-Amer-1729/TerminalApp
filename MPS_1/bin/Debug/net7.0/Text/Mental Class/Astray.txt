This state is reserved for the unfocused, a person who astray from the right path. He cannot, no matter what he does, return to back to focus on the task at hand. This happens a lot due to prolonged period of inactivity, consumption of content, etc. Breaking out of this state is difficult, and often requires timeout/break from any activity till your brain recharge.
