The class is designated for the most normal of states the mind of a person can be in. He is neither sad nor happy, he is not excited nor despressed, he is not motivated or demotivated, he is simply is.
In such case, one can exact more personal freedom on his actions. He can read, write, play, work, etc. In this state, the intuition of the person is talking to the person, guiding him to what he feels he wants to do. If he wants to work, so shall be it. If he wants to play, read, draw, so shall be it. The intuition will also warn the person not to go to deep into something so as not to fall into Astray state or, in the worst case, INFERNUM state.
